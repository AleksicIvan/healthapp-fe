This repository has a **frontend code** for **Healthapp/Nazdravlje** done with [React - Javascript Frontend Library](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for application design and User Interface.
The application structure is done following [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) strategy in order to build reusable and compatible logic and services that can be shared between React Web and React Native code.
